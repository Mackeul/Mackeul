# Hi, I'm Michael Laporte.
I guess you could call me a Jack-of-all-trades Software Developer.  I try to do and learn whatever is needed to get the job done.  Whether that is designing a subsystem using an Object Oriented Design pattern, writing Bash scripts to automate tasks and deployments, managing databases, doing web programming, or doing Virtual Machine and container administration, no task is too big or too small! :smile:

      - The plan is to have the master running on:

      - with workers on
        - a HP EliteDesk G2 (i5 + 32GB RAM)
        - and a Dell CS24 Rackmount server (2x XEON L5420 Quad Core + 24GB RAM + 6TB disks) -> This was my previous VM host running VMWare 6.0 on it, before I migrated to Proxmox.
